## Out-of-Scope Vulnerabilities
While we appreciate all efforts, the following are generally **not** considered valid findings under this policy:

- Issues in third-party services not under our control (e.g., Auth0, AWS, Stripe)
- Outdated browsers or platforms without active support
- Self-XSS or attacks requiring physical device access
- Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks or brute-force unless they expose substantive flaws
- Vulnerabilities requiring extensive social engineering of our staff or users
- Missing security headers that do not lead directly to exploitation
If in doubt, feel free to ask before investing significant effort.

## Public Disclosure
We request that you do not disclose details of any vulnerabilities until we have confirmed and resolved the issue. We support responsible public disclosure and are happy to coordinate timing and communications with you.
