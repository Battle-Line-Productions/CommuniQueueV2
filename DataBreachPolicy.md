# Data Breach Response Policy
_Last updated: April 19, 2025_

## 1. Purpose
The purpose of this policy is to establish a clear protocol for identifying, containing, assessing, responding to, and notifying stakeholders about actual or suspected data breaches involving personal or confidential information at BattleLine Productions LLC (“BattleLine” or “the Company”). This policy helps protect affected individuals, comply with legal obligations, and preserve trust in our services.

---

## 2. Scope
This policy applies to all staff, contractors, and systems involved in the processing or storage of customer or end user data on behalf of CommuniQueue, including any personal information handled via our SaaS systems.

---

## 3. Definition of a Data Breach
A “data breach” is any event resulting in unauthorized access to, disclosure of, loss, or destruction of personal or sensitive company/customer data. Examples include but are not limited to:

- Hacking or ransomware attacks
- Unauthorized access to protected data
- Accidental exposure of data due to misconfigured systems
- Loss or theft of devices containing customer data
- Internal misuse of access or system privileges
---

## 4. Breach Response Procedures
**a. Identification and Reporting** 

- Any staff, contractor, or vendor who suspects or learns of a potential data breach must immediately report the incident to the designated breach response contact at BattleLine (see Section 8).
**b. Initial Assessment** 

- The breach response team (or responsible manager) will promptly evaluate:
    - If a breach has occurred
    - The type of data involved (e.g., PII, financial, system data)
    - How much data is affected and whose data it is
**c. Containment and Eradication** 

- Take immediate steps to contain the breach (e.g., shutting down compromised systems, revoking credentials, disabling network access).
- Prevent further data loss or exposure.
**d. Investigation and Documentation** 

- Determine the cause, scope, and duration of the breach.
- Document facts, timeline, affected data, and users.
- Preserve evidence as needed for legal or forensic purposes.
**e. Notification** 

- Notify impacted Customers (tenant owners/administrators) without undue delay if their data has been, or is reasonably believed to have been, compromised.
- Notification will include the nature of the data involved, steps taken, recommended user actions, and company contact information for follow-up.
- If required by law (such as CCPA, certain state laws, or future GDPR use), notify affected individuals, regulators, and authorities as required.
**f. Remediation and Follow-Up** 

- Cooperate with affected parties to remediate harm and support recommended actions (password resets, monitoring, etc.).
- Take steps to prevent similar incidents in the future (security controls, staff training).
---

## 5. Record-Keeping
All data breach incidents—confirmed or suspected—will be recorded in a secure incident log, including investigation outcomes and notifications made.

---

## 6. Training and Awareness
All staff with access to customer data will receive periodic training on this policy, incident recognition, and breach reporting procedures.

---

## 7. Review and Updates
This policy shall be reviewed annually, or after any significant incident, and updated as necessary to reflect changes in laws, services, or best practices.

---

## 8. Points of Contact
All data breach reports or questions should be directed to:
**Email:** [﻿security@battlelineproductions.com](mailto:security@battlelineproductions.com)
**Attention:** Data Breach Response Team

---

## 9. Regulatory Considerations
If and when BattleLine serves customers in regions with enhanced breach notification obligations (e.g., EU/UK under GDPR), the Company will update this policy to comply with all mandatory notification timelines and documentation standards.
