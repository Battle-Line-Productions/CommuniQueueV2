1. Terms of Service / Customer Agreement
Outlines rights, responsibilities, permitted use, payment terms, warranty, and liability. You already have a draft!

Communicates how you collect, use, store, and share data; addresses privacy rights and compliance (GDPR, CCPA, etc.).
You’re already preparing one!

3. Security Policy
Publicly available. Describes how security researchers can contact you and your responsible disclosure process.
Done, but you may want an internal security and access control policy as well.

4. Data Breach Response Policy
Internal roadmap for responding to data incidents and regulatory notifications.
You now have a draft!

5. Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
Details the types of activities, content, or behaviors not allowed on your platform (spam, abuse, hacking, illegal content, etc.). Can be part of Terms or a standalone public document for large B2B/SaaS.

6. Internal Security and Access Controls Policy
Internal.
Explains how you manage employee/admin access to systems/data, password practices, secret/key handling, device security, and onboarding/offboarding routines.

7. Vendor/Subprocessor List & Agreements
Internal, but sometimes public for GDPR.
Documents all subprocessors (e.g., AWS, Stripe, SendGrid, Auth0) and that you have DPAs (Data Processing Agreements) in place where needed. You may need to present this to large customers.

8. Service Level Agreement (SLA)
For your customers (sometimes only enterprise).
Details uptime guarantees, support response times, exceptions, and remedies for failures/downtime.

9. Data Processing Addendum (DPA)
A legal attachment for customers governed by GDPR/UK/EU privacy laws.
Specifies how personal data is processed, roles (Controller/Processor), subprocessors, and users’ rights.

Every employee/contractor should sign one, covering confidentiality, info security, and intellectual property—ensuring all work product belongs to your company.

11. Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity Plan
Internal.
Describes how you restore service, data, and operations during major outages, AWS issues, or even non-technical disasters (e.g., if the founder is incapacitated).

12. Incident Response Plan
Internal, but you now have a data breach policy—a good start. A more detailed plan would cover full-cycle incidents (not just breaches): detection, assessment, mitigation, communication.

13. Change Management Policy
Internal.
Describes how you deploy code, review changes, approve major releases, and roll back in case of issues. Important for SOC 2, ISO 27001, or if you’re ever asked "How do you prevent bad code or accidental exposure?"

14. Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) Templates

Public or customer-facing.
