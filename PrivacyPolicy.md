# Privacy Policy for CommuniQueue  
_Last revised: April 19, 2025_

BattleLine Productions LLC ("we", "us", "our") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, retain, store, and share personal and other information when you use CommuniQueue, our SaaS platform for organizational messaging, notification, and tracking.

## 1. Information We Collect

We collect information as part of delivering CommuniQueue (“Service”) to our business customers (“Customers”) and their users (“Users”). The types of information we collect include:

- **Account Information:** Name, business email, company name, and other basic account details.
- **Usage Analytics:** Information about how Customers and Users interact with the Service, including access times, feature usage, and log data.
- **Communications Content:** Subject and body of notifications (emails/SMS/webhooks) transmitted via the platform. This data is encrypted at rest and may contain personal data as determined and provided by Customers.
- **Payment Information:** We use Stripe to process payments and do not directly handle or store card details. Stripe’s privacy policy governs that process.
- **Cookies and Website Analytics:** We collect information using cookies and similar technologies when you interact with our website, including but not limited to Google Analytics and Microsoft Clarity.

## 2. How We Use the Information

We use personal and usage information for the following purposes:

- To deliver, maintain, and improve CommuniQueue and related services.
- To provide customer support, respond to inquiries, and process account management functions.
- To facilitate payment processing via Stripe.
- To administer subscription and retention policies as described in your contract.
- To measure feature usage, diagnose technical issues, and improve product performance.
- To communicate with Customers about product updates, security notices, new features, or future products/services that may be of interest.
- For internal business purposes such as analytics and planning.
- To comply with legal obligations or requests from authorities, when required.

You control the content sent via CommuniQueue. We do not access, use, or share the content of your notifications except as needed to provide the Service, monitor its use, or comply with the law.

## 3. Data Retention and Export

- We retain your notification-related data for the term of your contract plus 90 days, unless a longer retention period is specified in your service plan.
- By default, non-analytic (detailed notification/message) data is accessible for 3 days after sending. Customers may opt to extend this for up to one year.
- After a notification’s retention period ends, we purge all personal and identifying data and retain only anonymized, aggregate analytics (e.g., counts of messages, delivery success/failure).
- Customers may export their data at any time, subject to technical limitations. No export containing third-party PII (other than limited fields such as email address, where permitted) is available via self-service.
- You may request deletion of your data at any time by contacting us. Requests will be processed as promptly as feasible, subject to legal and contractual requirements.

---

## 4. Data Security

- All data is encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption technologies.
- Fields containing content that may include PII (such as notification subject or body) are encrypted at the column level.
- Access to systems and data is restricted based on access controls, with all access logged and monitored.
- Transmissions between your browser and our platform are protected by HTTPS/TLS encryption.
- We recommend Customers follow best practices and avoid sending sensitive PII wherever possible.

## 5. Cookies and Analytics

- We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to operate our website, analyze usage, and improve our Service.
- We use third-party analytics tools, including Google Analytics and Microsoft Clarity, to help us understand website and application use patterns. These services may collect information sent by your browser as part of a web page request, such as cookies or your IP address.
- You may control cookies through your browser settings and, where required by law, will be given the option to consent to analytics cookies.

## 6. Disclosure to Third Parties

We do not sell personal information.  
We may share your information only in the following circumstances:

- **Service Providers:** With vendors and subprocessors who help us operate, support, or improve CommuniQueue (e.g., cloud hosting, payment processing, email/SMS delivery, analytics).
- **Legal Compliance:** If required to do so by law, regulation, court order, or at the request of competent authorities.
- **Business Transfers:** In connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization, or sale of assets, subject to notice as required by law.
